# Security: A Game of Resources

- Security is sometimes sold through fear.
- This tends to lead to poor decision making
- To make good decision we need to conserve our resources

## Tales from The Security Operations Center

- External scan vs Internal scan
- Alert fatigue

## Discussion
- Discuss: What threats have you observed in your online life? Bots, spam, phishing, bad urls etc
- Discuss: How much of a threat is a phishing email?
- Discuss: How much more of a threat is a spearphishing email?

# Goal of Today

- You will have commited a hands-on-keyboard simulated cyber-attack
- You will have learned how easy it is to be on the attack side
- You will learn some tactics, techniques and procedures for red team engagements

# NOTE
- You will NOT learn how to defend against these attacks
- We will focus on methodology for conducting attacks
- The attack mindset is much more valuable to establish than focusing on defense

# DISCUSS

Defending is harder than attacking

- Why do you think defending is harder than attacking?

# Outline
## Talkthrough of Attack Scenario: Zeegma Corporate Espionage
## Cyber Kill Chain
## Exercise I: Sending & Clicking on Phishing Emails 🎣
## Exercise II: Infecting Ourselves with malware 🤣 🦟
## Exercise III: Local Network Attacks & Other lulz (If enough time)
## Talkthrough: Selling Initial Access & Shodan 🏆 💸
## Digging deeper: Network Pivoting & Beyond ⛰️
## Summary 🧮

---
# Background on Cyber Kill Chain 
- The kill chain was originally developed by US government contractor Lockheed Martin in 2010ish
- It models how cyber attacks are conducted
- Can be a good mental model, not very useful in practice
- Today, other frameworks exists like MITRE-attack framework an the unified kill chain.

---
# Cyber Kill Chain (1/2)

## Reconnaissence 🔎

This is where attackers spend most of their time. Searching for clues on how to attack a target.

Typical valuable information is, emails, customers, IT infrastructure, domain names etc

## Weaponisation 🗡️, use info from recon to attack

The above information is compiled into something useful, like an email list to be used in a phishing attack.

It can also be used to compile an internet-facing IT asset list for vulnerability scanning.

## Delivery 🚚, engage target 

The weapon is delivered. In the case of phishing, you click send.

---
# Cyber Kill Chain (2/2)

## Exploitation 😈, use weakness

The target is baited into clicking the link, because the email said that HR had gotten a complaint of discrimination by the employee. 

hehe : ) or something like that.

## Installation 💾, install malware

The target downloads malware and gets infected from the link.

## Command & Control 🕹️, use compromised targets to further goals & objectives

The infected target phones home to an attacker controlled server.

## Actions on Objectives 🎯, get the info

The attacker can now use the infections to further their objectives and burrow deeper into the network.

---
# A Lightweight Cyber Kill Chain

Today we will do something like this
```
~~~graph-easy --as=boxart
[Recon1:Get knowit emails] - delivery -> [ Phish Targets ]
[ Phish Targets ] - login to o365 -> [ Recon2: Get CRM Users ]
[ Recon2: Get CRM Users ] - delivery -> [ Phish Targets ]
[ Phish Targets ] - login to CRM -> [ Primary Objective: Extract Data from CRM]
~~~
```
## Above kill chain is more similar to the unified kill chain
## Typically, attackers spend most time in the Recon phase

# Attack Scenario: Zeegma Corporate espionage against Knowit Solutions Cocreate

- You are cyber mercenaries who have been contracted to perform 
corporate espionage against Knowit Solutions Cocreate.
- Your employer, Zeegma, has been falling behind its competitor Cocreate
- Zeegma is desperate to know why all its customers have left to Knowit Solutions Cocreate. 


---



# Zeegma Hacking Objectives:

Here are your objectives

## **Primary Objective** 
is to compromise Cocreate's customer relationship management platform (CRM) by hacking users o365 accounts.
Using hacked accounts, you will relay customer relations information to Zeegma, and brief them on your findings.

## **Secondary Objective** 

is to establish persistance inside Cocreate's environment so that the Zeegma can repeatedly extract business intelligence from the victim.

### What is persistance?

- Persistance is typically a backdoor into an IT system.
- In general, it is any mechanism that let's the adversary to keep its foothold in the target organisation, 
- **Examples**: Custom admin access to the CRM, A rogue Office 365 account, a remote access trojan or similar.

---
# Action Plan (1/3) The CRM System:
### Reconnaissence 1
-  Find some email addresses of Cocreate

### Phish the Target
-  Send targeted phishing emails

### Initial Foothold
-  Login to o365 using compromised 2fa tokens

### Reconnaissence 2

-  Search emails, teams and other instant messages for references to the CRM system

---
# Action Plan (2/3): Primary Objective, The CRM System

Here what we will do to acheive the primary objective:

## Weaponization

- Figure who is uses the CRM system from the info collected.

## Phish the CRM Users
- Send more phishing emails, targeting users of the CRM system this time, get the login and password.
## Execute on Primary Objective
- Login to the CRM system and extract the necessary data.

---

# Action Plan (3/3): Secondary Objective, Establish Persistance

## Recon 3 & Weaponization

- Figure out who is domain admin in invativas active directory

## Exploitation

- Phish the domain administrators

## Execute on Secondary Objective

- Create a backdoor o365 account

# Exercise Hacking Time

## Show & Tell

Let's go around the table and read each other's phishing emails.
Then we do a vote on wrote the best email! : D

## Get phished

- I will log in to a VPS I have setup and start the phishing server for o365
- At my command, click this link [Totally legit link](https://login.knowit.pictures/HtUhNZtf)
- Authenticate against it 
- We will read through the logs together

---

# Get Phished

## Step 1: Click the link
## Step 2: Let user go through the authentication flow
## Step 3: Look in the Evilginx2 logs
## Step 4: Run this command

```bash
sessions
```
Followed by
```bash
sessions n
```

where `n` is the session that was captured. Copy paste the JSON.

## Step 5: Open the below URL in Brave

https://portal.office.com

## Step 6: Use the cookie editor

- Clear current cookies
- Import the cookie in clipboard

## Step 7: Refresh portal.office.com

- You should now be logged in as the phished user. 

## Step 8: Experiment :)

- Feel free to share tokens with each other to log in as the other user
- To Copy-paste cookies, use this chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm?hl=en

# Command & Control (c2)

## What is C2?

Command & control is a way to setup a client / server infrastructure for infected users. Here are some command an control frameworks:

## Cobalt Strik

Industry leader for C2

link: https://www.cobaltstrike.com/

## Empire, 

Go to framework for that utlizes Powershell which is very good for Windows environments, I think!?

link: https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire

### Custom Command & Control, 

Advanced C2 framework for rapid deployment of new implants

Link: https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/C3

## Further Reading

Here is a larger list of c2 frameworks
